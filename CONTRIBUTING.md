# CONTRIBUTING

To contribute to the Yassa-Rollbar you can send us a 
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) using GitHub, that's it!

I only ask you to use a couple of conventions:

 - If you want to propose a new or enhance an existing feature use the `feature/<name>` branch name convention,
   where `<name>` is the short description of the feature that you want to create or enhance;

 - To fix bug use the `bugfix/<name>` branch name convention,
   where `<name>` is the short description of the bug that you want to fix;

## Contributing flow

### Forking the project into your github account

You can **fork** this project within github, as described on [help.github.com](http://help.github.com/forking/).
This fork will show up on your own github profile, and can be checked out to your local machine.
You don't need a webserver on there, or run any project-specific scripts. 

### Updating your project fork

You should update your own repository every now and then from "upstream" (the original repository),
to ensure you make any changes on the most recent version of files.
See "[Pulling in upstream changes](http://help.github.com/forking/#pulling_in_upstream_changes)" on help.github.com.

### Committing changes back through "pull requests"

See "[Pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)" on help.github.com.
